##README File for Project 3 (Ann Lurie)

**Project URL:**
[http://p3.annlurie.me/](http://p3.annlurie.me/)

**Project Description:**
This project is a PHP application built in Laravel that provides two 'developer toolkit' capabilities to end users. One tool generates 1-99 paragraphs of lorem ipsum text to use as placeholder content when designing UI or layouts. The other tool generates 1-99 names (and optional additional attributes) of users for testing, layout, or other purposes.

**Demo Information:**
I plan to demo this project in person during a section meeting.

**Details for TA/Instructor:**
I tried fairly late in the game to get more comfortable with Blade syntax, and will continue to play around with converting the existing HTML forms, but am submitting with HTML. Please take a look at the commented-out sections of each form page to see how successful (or not) I've been in making that transition.
